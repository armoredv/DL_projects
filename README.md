This repository contains the pytorch implementation of a Deep learning model used for COVID-19 Action-Radiology-CXR. 
The model is trained on the dataset containing various publicly available CXR image sources and it consists of a five-fold cross-validation based training.

The primary task of the model is to classify a given CXR image into “COVID-19”, “Other Pneumonia” and “Non-pneumonia” classes. The “Non-pneumonia” class contains images from healthy subjects as well as subjects suffering from diseases other than pneumonia.

In this project I have applied Convolutional Neural Network along with the 5 - fold cross Validation ,Drop-out and L1,L2 regularization in order to improove the performance of the model and have tested this model on a very diverse testing data set generated from various parts of world.
